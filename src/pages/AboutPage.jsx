            <h1>About Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy</h1>
            <p>Mr. Darcy is a wealthy young gentleman with an income exceeding £10,000 a year 2
            (equivalent to over £13,000,000 a year in relative income3) and the proprietor of Pemberley,
            a large estate in Derbyshire, England. Darcy first meets Elizabeth Bennet at a ball, where
            he makes rather demeaning remarks about her while she is within earshot. Gradually he becomes
            attracted to her and later attempts to court her while simultaneously struggling against his
            continued feelings of superiority. Darcy disapproves when his friend Bingley, develops a serious
            attachment to Elizabeth's elder sister Jane, and persuades Bingley that Jane does not return
            his feelings (which Darcy honestly but inaccurately believes). He later explains this seeming
            hypocrisy by asserting "I was kinder to [Bingley] than to myself". Although he doesn't realise
            it, Mr. Wickham's tale of how Darcy mistreated him and Elizabeth's later discovery of Darcy's
            interference in Bingley and Jane's budding relationship, along with Elizabeth's previous
            observations of Darcy's arrogance, conceit, and selfish disdain of the feelings of others, has
            caused her to dislike him intensely.
            Eventually, Mr. Darcy declares his love for Elizabeth and asks for her hand. He reminds her of
            the large gap in their social status. Elizabeth is offended and vehemently refuses him,
            expressing her reasons for disliking him, including her knowledge of his interference with Jane
            and Bingley and the account she received from Mr. Wickham of Darcy's alleged unfair treatment
            toward him. Insulted by Darcy's arrogant retorts, Elizabeth says that his proposal prevented
            her from feeling concerns for him she "might have felt had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike
            manner". Darcy departs in anger and mortification and the next morning, writes and hand
            delivers a letter to Elizabeth in which he defends his wounded honour, reveals the motives for
            his interference in Jane and Bingley's relationship, and gives a full account of his dealings
            with Wickham, who had attempted to seduce and elope with Darcy's younger sister, Georgiana, the
            previous summer.
            Although initially angered by Elizabeth's vehement refusal and harsh criticism, Darcy is
            shocked to discover the reality of how his behaviour is perceived by others, particularly
            Elizabeth, and commits himself to re-evaluate his actions. A few months later, Darcy
            unexpectedly encounters Elizabeth when she is visiting his estate in Derbyshire with her aunt
            and uncle. Elizabeth is first embarrassed to be discovered at Pemberley, having only visited on
            the belief that Darcy was absent; however, she is surprised to discover a marked change in
            Darcy's manner. Having responded to Elizabeth's criticism, Darcy is now determined to display
            the "gentlemanlike manner" she accused him of lacking and astonishes her with his kindness
            towards both her and her relations.
            On discovering that Elizabeth's youngest sister Lydia has fallen prey to and run off with 
            Mr. Wickham, Darcy tracks them down and induces Wickham to marry Lydia, thus saving both Lydia
            and her family from social disgrace. Darcy's intervention was done not to win Elizabeth—he 
            attempted to keep her from knowing of his involvement—but rather to ease her distress 
            (the narrator hints through Mr. Bennet that Darcy's intervention to help Elizabeth may have 
            cost him as much as a year's income: "Wickham's a fool if he takes [Lydia] with a farthing 
            less than ten thousand pounds"). Darcy also felt partially responsible for failing to warn 
            Elizabeth's family and the public of Wickham's true character.
            Darcy then releases Bingley to return to Longbourn and to Jane, accepting his misjudgement of 
            her character. Accompanying his friend to Longbourn, Darcy proposes to Elizabeth again, who 
            accepts his proposal</p>
